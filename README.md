Java + Spring Boot

This is a ***BASIC*** Java v8 + Spring Boot meant to just get the api endpoint needed to show the data requested. 

Run the Spring Boot Application like any normal Java app on your preferred IDE.

It was CORS allowing all access for the time being just for the purpose of the demo.

you must have an env variable called ***WEATHER_API_KEY*** (or you can change the name of it in the application properties file if you already have an existing one and don't want to change the name). Use your own weather api key that you get.
